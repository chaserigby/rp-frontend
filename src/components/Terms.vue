(&ldquo;Racepass,&rdquo; &ldquo;we&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo;). &nbsp; You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don&rsquo;t have the right to use the Services. &nbsp;Your using the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. &nbsp;These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the </span><span class="c0"><router-link class="c12" to="/privacy">Privacy Policy</router-link></span><span class="c11">.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c9 c15">Will these Terms ever change?</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services. &nbsp;We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the racepass.com website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">If you don&rsquo;t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. &nbsp;If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us. </span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Certain features of the Service allow you to register for, and participate in, various races and other events (&ldquo;Events&rdquo;) which are hosted, organized and/or provided by third parties (&ldquo;Organizers&rdquo;). You understand that during your participation in Events, you may be exposed to a variety of hazards and risks, foreseen or unforeseen, which are inherent in each Event and cannot be eliminated without destroying the unique character of the Event. These inherent risks include, but are not limited to, the dangers of serious personal injury, property damage, and death (&ldquo;Injuries and Damages&rdquo;) from exposure to the hazards inherent therein and Racepass has not tried to contradict or minimize your understanding of these risks. You agree that you know that Injuries and Damages can occur by natural causes or activities of other persons, animals, other participants, Organizers or third parties, either as a result of negligence or because of other reasons.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">You understand that risks of such Injuries and Damages are involved in Events and you appreciate that you may have to exercise extra care for your own person and for others around you in the face of such hazards.

      <li class="c8"><span class="c3">To the fullest extent allowed by law, you agree to WAIVE, DISCHARGE CLAIMS, AND RELEASE FROM LIABILITY Racepass, its officers, directors, employees, agents, and all Organizers from any and all liability on account of, or in any way resulting from Injuries and Damages, even if caused by negligence of Racepass, any Organizer, or their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and leaders, in any way connected with any Event. &nbsp;You further agree to HOLD HARMLESS Racepass, its officers, directors, employees, agents, and leaders from any claims, damages, injuries or losses caused by your own negligence while a participant in an Event. &nbsp;You understand and intend that this assumption of risk and release is binding upon your heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, and includes any minors accompanying you on the Outing. &nbsp;You expressly waive all rights conferred by Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, or any substantially similar law which states in substance: &ldquo;A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known to him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.&rdquo;</span></li>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c9">Do I have to grant any licenses to Racepass or to other users</span><span class="c18">?</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c13">Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your &ldquo;User Submission.&rdquo; &nbsp;Some User Submissions are viewable by other users. &nbsp;In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions. &nbsp;Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our </span><span class="c0"><router-link class="c12" to="/privacy">Privacy Policy</router-link></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable information.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c11">For all User Submissions, you hereby grant Racepass a license to translate, modify (for technical </span><span class="c3">purposes, for example making sure your content is viewable on an iPhone as well as a computer) and reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such User Submissions, in each case to enable us to operate the Services, as described in more detail below. &nbsp;This is a license only &ndash; your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">If you store a User Submission in your own personal Racepass account, in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you (a &ldquo;Personal User Submission&rdquo;), you grant Racepass the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Personal User Submission accessible to you and providing the Services necessary to do so.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">If you share a User Submission only in a manner that only certain specified users can view (for example, a private message to one or more other users) (a &ldquo;Limited Audience User Submission&rdquo;), then you grant Racepass the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Limited Audience User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Limited Audience User Submission accessible to such other specified users, and providing the Services necessary to do so. &nbsp;Also, you grant such other specified users a license to access that Limited Audience User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">If you share a User Submission publicly on the Services and/or in a manner that more than just you or certain specified users can view, or if you provide us (in a direct email or otherwise) with any feedback, suggestions, improvements, enhancements, and/or feature requests relating to the Services (each of the foregoing, a &ldquo;Public User Submission&rdquo;), then you grant Racepass the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Public User Submission for the purpose of making that Public User Submission accessible to all Racepass users and providing the Services necessary to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in that Public User Submission in connection with the Services for any purpose. &nbsp;Also, you grant all other users of the Services a license to access that Public User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c9">What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright</span><span class="c18">?</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c13">You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the &ldquo;DMCA&rdquo;), as it relates to online service providers, like </span><span class="c11">Racepass</span><span class="c13">, being asked to remove material that allegedly violates someone&rsquo;s copyright. &nbsp;We respect others&rsquo; intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged infringers; to review our complete Copyright Dispute Policy and learn how to report potentially infringing content, </span><span class="c11">click </span><span class="c0"><router-link class="c12" to="/copyright">here</router-link></span><span class="c13">. &nbsp;To learn more about the DMCA, click </span><span class="c11 c22"><a class="c12" href="http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1488012712508000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGFlujWbp3bCQropqsCg92NGivfEA">here</a></span><span class="c13">. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c9">Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services</span><span class="c18">?</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk, and we aren&rsquo;t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. &nbsp; We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. &nbsp;We can&rsquo;t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it. &nbsp;You will keep all your registration information accurate and current. &nbsp;You are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Racepass. When you access third party websites or use third party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Racepass is not responsible for such risks. &nbsp;We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website or service that you visit or utilize. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Racepass has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services. In addition, Racepass will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third party site or service. By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website or service. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. You agree that Racepass shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you agree that Racepass is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release Racepass, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: &quot;A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c9 c15">Will Racepass ever change the Services?</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">We&rsquo;re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time. &nbsp;We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn&rsquo;t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c9 c15">Does Racepass cost anything?</span></p>
    <ul class="c7 lst-kix_list_4-0 start">
      <li class="c8"><span class="c4">Paid Services</span><span class="c3">. Certain of our Services may be subject to payments now or in the future (the &ldquo;Paid Services&rdquo;). &nbsp;Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a Paid Service are deemed part of this Agreement.<br />
    </span></li>
      <li class="c8"><span class="c4">Billing.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;We use a third-party payment processor (the &ldquo;Payment Processor&rdquo;) to bill you through a payment account linked to your account on the Services (your &ldquo;Billing Account&rdquo;) for use of the Paid Services. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to this Agreement. We are not responsible for error by the Payment Processor. By choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your &ldquo;Payment Method&rdquo;). You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment.<br />
    </span></li>
      <li class="c8"><span class="c4">Payment Method</span><span class="c3">. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.<br />
    </span></li>
      <li class="c8"><span class="c4">Recurring Billing</span><span class="c3">. Some of the Paid Services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT. TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, GO TO </span><span class="c13">YOUR PROFILE SETTINGS</span><span class="c3">.<br />
    </span></li>
      <li class="c8"><span class="c4">Current Information Required</span><span class="c3">. YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT. YOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD. CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE </span><span class="c13">IN YOUR PROFILE SETTINGS</span><span class="c3">. &nbsp;IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.<br />
    </span></li>
      <li class="c8"><span class="c4">Change in Amount Authorized</span><span class="c3">. If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.<br />
    </span></li>
      <li class="c8"><span class="c4">Auto-Renewal for Subscription Services</span><span class="c3">. Unless you opt out of auto-renewal, which can be done through your </span><span class="c0 c20"><router-link class="c12" to="/account">Account Settings</router-link></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">, any Subscription Services you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate. To change or resign your Subscription Services at any time, go to </span><span class="c0 c20"><router-link class="c12" to="/account">Account Settings</router-link></span><span class="c3">. &nbsp;If you terminate a Subscription Service, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you won&#39;t be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period.<br />
    </span></li>
      <li class="c8"><span class="c4">Reaffirmation of Authorization</span><span class="c3">. Your non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.<br />
    </span></li>
      <li class="c8"><span class="c4">Free Trials and Other Promotions</span><span class="c3">. Any free trial or other promotion that provides access to a Paid Service must be used within the specified time of the trial. You must stop using a Paid Service before the end of the trial period in order to avoid being charged for that Paid Service. If you cancel prior to the end of the trial period and are inadvertently charged for a Paid Service, please contact us at </span><span class="c13">info@racepass.com</span><span class="c3">. &nbsp;</span></li>
